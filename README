St. Somewhere
===============================================================================

Named after a Jimmy Buffett tune, this calculator is designed mainly with
discrete math and computer science students in mind. It's purpose is ease
of conversion and simple operations on numbers in different bases. Future
plans include the addition of more complex capabilities, with solving
systems of congruences and the extended Euclidean algorithm first on the
list.

Installation
===============================================================================

Run './configure', then 'make', and (if desired) 'make install'. Don't forget
to elevate your privileges when attempting 'make install'.

This program will not compile on the Windows operating system. If you run
Windows, then I'm sorry. Try Virtual Box.

If running the make generates a string of errors, try the following fix:

Open the Makefile in your favorite text editor, and replace the line

LIBS=

with the line

LIBS= "-lncurses"

You may also need to install the ncurses package.
You can find that package at gnu.org/software/ncurses

Running
===============================================================================

All the commands are listed on the left hand side. When you enter hexadecimal
numbers, you need to use upper case for A-F. If you want to convert several
numbers at one time, enter them all onto the stack first, then switch bases.

Known Issues
===============================================================================
None at this time.

Any issues crop up, feel free to notify me. jwallace.git at gee mail.com
