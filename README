St. Somewhere
===============================================================================

Named after a Jimmy Buffett tune, this calculator is designed mainly with
discrete math and computer science students in mind. It's purpose is ease
of conversion and simple operations on numbers in different bases. Future
plans include the addition of more complex capabilities, with solving
systems of congruences and the extended Euclidean algorithm first on the
list.

Installation
===============================================================================

Run './configure', then 'make', and (if desired) 'make install'. Don't forget
to elevate your privileges when attempting 'make install'.

This program will not compile on the Windows operating system. If you run
Windows, then I'm sorry. Try Virtual Box.

Running
===============================================================================

All the commands are listed on the left hand side. When you enter hexadecimal
numbers, you need to use upper case for A-F. If you want to convert several
numbers at one time, enter them all onto the stack first, then switch bases.

Known Issues
===============================================================================

I have noticed a random bug that I am unable to reproduce as of yet.
Occasionally the stack will switch all empty values to zero's. Should this
happen, either backspace to clear them or quit and restart. As soon as I
find the reason and patch it, I'll release a new version.

Any other issues crop up, feel free to notify me. jwallace.git at gee mail.com
